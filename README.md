# Board game creator
I built a board games platform that allows you to easily create and add a new board games 
without changing the existing code.
The code is open for extension and closed for modification.

## The games i created
I also build 3 different games and added to the platform:
***Four in a Row***
***TIC Tac Toe***
and ***Avalon***
every game is implemented a different logic but the 
general structure of all games is the same.

## Object-oriented design
This project also takes into account the **SOLID** principles of the *OOP*.

## Supported OS
This game was developed on windows but should be supported in any other OS with zero to little effort.
